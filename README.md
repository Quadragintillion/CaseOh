# CaseOh
Turns you into CaseOh.

<br>

This was originally made as an "application session" (an event that people had to make a video about to apply) for the [Likesteal SMP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtoY92tHupM).

It allows you to give a player of your choosing CaseOh powers with `/caseoh <username>`. This plugin is best used in combination with a disguise plugin.

CaseOh is given 125 hearts and can eat blocks instantly by clicking on them, which makes him grow bigger and heals a single heart per block eaten. As he grows larger, he starts eating larger chunks of the world.

Dropping from any height that would normally deal fall damage instead creates an explosion around him.

If there is a limited size world, eventually eating too much will cause him to fall in the void and die.

Once he reaches scale 2 (4 blocks tall), a bossbar appears.
